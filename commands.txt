#for Reactotron:
adb reverse tcp:9090 tcp:9090
adb reverse --list

#in case Control+M (aka the Shake on real device) isnt bringing up menu on device
adb shell input keyevent 82

#sometimes Control+M still not working, try clicking on Expo in the Nav Drawer and 'clearing data'... as i noticed this when trying to run on device that somehow its switched to production mode and therefore not making dev menu popup (so couldn't debug).

#expo and reactnative versions need to be in sync in package.json/app.json:
